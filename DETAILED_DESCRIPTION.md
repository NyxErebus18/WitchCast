### What does WhiskerCast do?
WhiskerCast lets users select a location and date to discover the probability of extreme weather conditionsâ€”very hot, cold, wet, windy, or uncomfortableâ€”based on historical NASA data.

### How does it work?
- Users input a location (via text or map pin)
- Select a date using a whimsical calendar scroll
- App queries NASA datasets (POWER, MERRA-2) to calculate probabilities
- Results are visualized with seasonal backgrounds, animated icons, and a mood meter

### Benefits
- Helps users plan outdoor events months in advance
- Makes climate data accessible and delightful
- Encourages climate awareness through playful design
- Supports accessibility and seasonal customization

### Goals
To enchant users with a personalized weather oracle thatâ€™s both functional and inclusiveâ€”bridging data science and storytelling.

### Tools Used
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Framer Motion, Styled-Components
- **Fonts**: Uncial Antiqua (titles), Cormorant Unicase (body)
- **Backend**: NASA POWER API, MERRA-2 datasets
- **AI Tools**: Microsoft Copilot for code generation, UI design, and documentation
