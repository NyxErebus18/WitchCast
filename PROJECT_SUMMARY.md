## 🧙‍♀️ High-Level Project Summary

WhiskerCast is a fantasy-themed weather app that transforms historical NASA climate data into enchanting insights for outdoor planning. Users select a location and date to discover the likelihood of adverse weather conditions—such as extreme heat, cold, wind, or rain—months in advance.

Unlike traditional forecasts, WhiskerCast uses decades of Earth observation data to calculate probabilities of discomfort. It presents this data through animated seasonal backgrounds, magical weather cards, and a mood meter that translates climate stats into whimsical verdicts like “Potion-perfect” or “Stormy gloom.”

WhiskerCast is important because it makes climate awareness joyful, accessible, and inclusive—especially for users planning events, travel, or outdoor rituals.
